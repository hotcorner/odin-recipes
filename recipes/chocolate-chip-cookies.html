        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Here's an easy recipe for chocolate chip cookies.</p>
        <p>Do NOT over cook cookies. They will come out hot and doughy, but as they cool, they will solidfy into a soft
            cookie.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Cups Flour (bleached)</li>
            <li>1 Cup Sugar</li>
            <li>1 + 1/2 Sticks of Butter</li>
            <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
            <li>2 Teaspons Vanilla</li>
            <li>A bag of your favorite morsals, i.e:
                <ol>
                    <li>Semi-sweet chips</li>
                    <li>Peanut Butter chips</li>
                    <li>Mint chips</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>1 + 1/2 Teaspons Coarse Salt</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons Baking Soda</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix dry ingredients (flour, cocoa, salt, baking soda) in a medium bowl, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Mix sugar and softened butter in a mixer on high until it's whipped into a cream.</li>
            <li>Slow mixer to slowest setting and add each egg.</li>
            <li>Add vanilla, and turn up mixer to mix VERY WELL.</li>
            <li>Slow mixer to slowest setting, and carefully add dry ingredients to the mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Allow to thoroughly mix, but not for TOO long (stop once all dry ingreients look mixed in).</li>
            <li>Hand mix in the bag of morsals.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Pre-heat your oven to 350 F (325 F if it's a convection oven). Rolls dough into 25g balls, and spread evenly
            on a
            lined cookie sheet. Cook for 8-9 minutes. Let cool on the sheet for 2 minutes before moving cookies to a
            rack.
        </p>
        <h4>Frozen Cookie Logs</h4>
        <p>Alternatively, I like to roll the dough into long rolls about 1 inch in diameter, and freeze them. Then I can
            slice off only what I need (about a half inch at a time), let them thaw in the oven while the oven is
            pre-heating, and have fresh baked cookies at any time.</p>
        <p>You will need to pull the cookies out of the oven at the 8 minute mark doing this. </p>
